# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
    I chose Rainbow. The reason I chose Rainbow was mostly to make the interface come alive a bit more.
    Colorize is a neat gem, but Rainbow has more features to make the terminal view of program more enjoyable.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
    a) Feature 1...Delete Multiple items
        list method delete can now take multiple arguments
    b) Feature 2...Update priority
        list items of todo type can have priority updated

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
    ~2 hours

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
    Using new gems

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
    Delete Multiple items
        I altered the list delete method to take in any number of parameters.
        Since the index of the item might change if you delete an item from the front of the list,
        I sorted and reversed the indices array to account for that problem.

    Update priority
        I added an update priority method that allows todo items to have their priority changed
        as long as it's a valid priority option. It's only available for todo type items.
        Because of that, I added another error, ItemDoesntHaveMethod that displays the string
        "That item cannot do that action"

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
    Using better Ruby logic for my conditionals - I know they're still more clunky than they need to be.
